# Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Data Engineering 

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Somerset NHS Foundation Trust Data Engineering Team. This project aims to design, develop, and implement a complete data warehousing solution to streamline data management, improve analysis capabilities, and provide robust data-driven decision support.

## Introduction
The site holds our working environment for a modern data warehouse solution. 

## Main Structure
The warehouse is structured in three distinct layers 

1. **Extract Layer**: Responsible for extracting raw data from various source systems.
2. **Business Layer**: This is where data transformation occurs and business logic is applied to the raw data extracted.
3. **Presentation Layer**: The final layer where data is organised and presented in a user-friendly format for querying and analysis.

Issues and requests will be recorded against the project.
